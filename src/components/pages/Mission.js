                We differentiate ourselves by ensuring each player is taught uniquely to their own playing style 
                rather than generic cookie-cutter coaching.
                We not only help our students achieve success on the court, but off the court as well. 
                We stress the importance of time management, academics, and many of the life lessons you gain from the sport. 
                GG promises to provide all students with the tools they need to achieve their version of success.
